Starting entirely from scratch, the student had only a vague idea for a language-learning app. Without using any generative AI, they spent the initial phase brainstorming on paper, sketching out different screen sequences and decision points for the user registration and first-lesson experience. This conceptual work focused on planning the app's structure and enumerating the necessary features. The student's primary deliverable was a set of these hand-drawn diagrams and notes that outlined the application's logic before any digital wireframing would begin."

Starting with the non-working code, they pasted the error message into an AI assistant. The AI's text explained several common causes, including null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows. Using these concepts as a guide, the student devised their own diagnostic plan. They returned to their code and manually inserted print statements at several key points to trace variable states and identify the exact location where memory became invalid. This systematic, self-directed investigation led them to the root cause, which they then fixed and committed."

    "vignette": "In a data science course, a student was reviewing code for their team project. They found a working Python script that used a complex, nested list comprehension that was difficult to read. For a quality review, they asked an AI assistant, \"What are general strategies to make a complex Python list comprehension more readable?\" The AI's explanation offered two common alternatives: breaking it into multiple lines or rewriting it as a standard for loop. The student identified the for loop as the most straightforward option presented. Following that specific recommendation, they manually rewrote the section of code as a multi-line loop and submitted the change."

    "vignette": "In a team data science project, a student's Python script for data processing was working correctly but used a dense, nested list comprehension. To improve readability for their teammates, they asked an AI assistant for strategies to make the code clearer. The AI explained two common alternatives: breaking the comprehension into multiple lines or rewriting it as a standard for-loop. The student used this advice as a conceptual starting point for a more robust solution. They manually designed and implemented a new helper function that encapsulated the complex filtering logic, adding a clear docstring explaining its purpose. This refactoring not only simplified the main script but also made the logic reusable elsewhere in the project."
